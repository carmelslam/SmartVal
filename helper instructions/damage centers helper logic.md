EXPLANATION NUMBER ONE : 

Overview
You indicated you weren’t sure how the flow works. It’s important to ask for clarification instead of blindly coding. Below is a clear description of the workflow and data structures. This should help keep the helper intact after modifications and avoid reverting it to an earlier state.
1. Assessment Section
This section aggregates costs for each damage center. For every damage center, record:
Works: Total cost of work items.
Parts: Total cost of parts required.
Repairs: Total cost of repair tasks.
Total without VAT: Sum of works, parts, and repairs before VAT.
Total with VAT: The same sum including VAT.
Each damage center has its own structured object:
{
  "damage_centers_summary": {
    "Damage center 1": {
      "Works": "<numeric total of work costs>",
      "Parts": "<numeric total of parts costs>",
      "Repairs": "<numeric total of repair costs>",
      "Total without VAT": "<sum of Works + Parts + Repairs>",
      "Total with VAT": "<sum including VAT>"
    },
    "Damage center 2": {
      "Works": "<numeric total of work costs>",
      "Parts": "<numeric total of parts costs>",
      "Repairs": "<numeric total of repair costs>",
      "Total without VAT": "<sum of Works + Parts + Repairs>",
      "Total with VAT": "<sum including VAT>"
    },
    "Damage center 3": {
      "Works": "<numeric total of work costs>",
      "Parts": "<numeric total of parts costs>",
      "Repairs": "<numeric total of repair costs>",
      "Total without VAT": "<sum of Works + Parts + Repairs>",
      "Total with VAT": "<sum including VAT>"
    }
    // add additional damage centers as needed
  },
  "totals": {
    "Damage center 1": "<Total with VAT for damage center 1>",
    "Damage center 2": "<Total with VAT for damage center 2>",
    "Damage center 3": "<Total with VAT for damage center 3>",
    // add additional center totals as needed
    "Total without VAT": "<aggregated sum of all centers before VAT>",
    "Total with VAT": "<aggregated sum of all centers after VAT>"
  }
}

2. Centers Data Source
All damage centers are stored under a centers section. This is the primary data source where you pull information from. Each entry contains:
Id
Damage center number (sequence: 1, 2, 3, …)
Location and Description
Works array, containing:
takana389: “כן”
works: a list of work items (category, cost, comments, timestamp, source)
works_meta: details about item count, total cost, status, and timestamp.
Parts array, containing:
parts_meta: totals and timestamp
parts_required: list of parts with names, quantities, prices, sources, and availability
parts_search: search results and metadata
takana389: “כן”
Repairs array, containing:
repairs: list of repair items (name, cost, description, timestamp, source)
repairs_meta: totals and timestamp
Summary fields for total works, parts, repairs, totals with and without VAT.
Each damage center is stored as its own JSON block under centers.
3. Current Damage Center
The current damage center holds data for the damage center being edited. Its structure is identical to a stored damage center. When the user is working on damage center number N, it lives here. Once saved (for example, after the final page of the wizard or when navigating away), the data moves from current to centers, and the current object resets to an empty template.
4. Flow Principles
Initialization: When the wizard opens, it starts a new damage center (#1) in the current section with blank fields.
Saving: When the user completes the last page or navigates away, the current damage center is added to centers, and current is cleared.
New Damage Centers: Starting a new damage center clears the form, assigns the next sequential number (2, 3, etc.), and uses the same flow.
Editing Existing Centers: The dropdown on the first page lists all damage centers from centers. Selecting one loads its data into the wizard for editing or deletion.
Summary Page: The final page shows a collapsible summary for each damage center, displaying totals (works, parts, repairs, without VAT, with VAT) along with its name and location. After listing all damage centers, include an overall total.
5. Parts Search
The parts search is handled by an external module. The wizard does not perform the search itself; instead, it receives webhook responses with search results and stores them in the parts_search section. The parts search interface (e.g., an iframe) suggests parts to the user as they type, based on the captured search results. This search operates independently of the damage centers helper.

EXPLANATION NUMBER TWO : 


Clarification and Flow Overview
You mentioned that you did not understand the flow. When that happens, you should ask for clarification before writing code rather than attempting to implement blindly. The goal is to keep the helper functioning properly without reverting to an earlier state.
1. Assessment Section
For each damage center, the assessment section should capture all costs and totals. The structure for each damage center is as follows:
{
  "damage_centers_summary": {
    "Damage center 1": {
      "Works": "<numeric total of work costs>",
      "Parts": "<numeric total of parts costs>",
      "Repairs": "<numeric total of repair costs>",
      "Total without VAT": "<sum of Works + Parts + Repairs>",
      "Total with VAT": "<sum including VAT>"
    },
    "Damage center 2": {
      "Works": "<numeric total of work costs>",
      "Parts": "<numeric total of parts costs>",
      "Repairs": "<numeric total of repair costs>",
      "Total without VAT": "<sum of Works + Parts + Repairs>",
      "Total with VAT": "<sum including VAT>"
    },
    "Damage center 3": {
      "Works": "<numeric total of work costs>",
      "Parts": "<numeric total of parts costs>",
      "Repairs": "<numeric total of repair costs>",
      "Total without VAT": "<sum of Works + Parts + Repairs>",
      "Total with VAT": "<sum including VAT>"
    }
    // add additional damage centers as needed
  },
  "totals": {
    "Damage center 1": "<Total with VAT for damage center 1>",
    "Damage center 2": "<Total with VAT for damage center 2>",
    "Damage center 3": "<Total with VAT for damage center 3>",
    // add additional center totals as needed
    "Total without VAT": "<aggregated sum of all centers before VAT>",
    "Total with VAT": "<aggregated sum of all centers after VAT>"
  }
}

There will be as many damage center objects as necessary (Damage center 1, Damage center 2, etc.).
2. Centers Data Source
All damage centers are stored in a centers section, which is your master data source. Each entry includes identifiers, location, a description, and arrays of works, parts, and repairs with their metadata. Below is the complete structure for a single damage center entry:
{
  "Id": "<unique identifier>",
  "Damage center Number": "1, 2, 3, 4, …",
  "Location": "<location string>",
  "Description": "<description string>",

  "Works": {
    "takana389": "כן",
    "works": [

      },
      {
        "category": "כל עבודות הפחחות כולל פירוקים והרכבות",
        "cost": 434,
        "comments": "work 2",

        "source": "wizard_inline_component"
      }
    ],
    "works_meta": {

    },
    "parts_required": [
      {
        "name": "parts 2",
        "תיאור": "damage",
        "כמות": 1,
        "מחיר": "₪234",
        "price": 234,
        "quantity": 1,

      }
    },

  },

  "Repairs": {
    "repairs": [
      {
        "name": "repair bumper",
        "cost": 430,
        "description": "bend thee bender",
        "added_at": "2025-08-13T19:50:15.655Z",
        "source": "wizard_inline_component"
      }
    ],
    "repairs_meta": {
      "total_items": 1,
      "total_cost": 430,
      "timestamp": "2025-08-13T19:50:15.721Z"
    }
  },

  "Summary": {
    "Total works": "<numeric total of works>",
    "Total parts": "<numeric total of parts>",
    "Total repairs": "<numeric total of repairs>",
    "Total without VAT": "<sum before VAT>",
    "Total with VAT": "<sum including VAT>"
  }
}
Each damage center in centers will follow this template, with its own values for items, costs, and metadata.
3. Current Damage Center
The current damage center holds data for the center the user is actively working on. It uses the exact same structure as a damage center in centers. When editing is finished—such as saving on the last page or moving to another stage—the current damage center is pushed into centers, and the current object is reset.
4. Flow Principles
Starting: Opening the wizard initiates Damage Center 1. A blank form fills the current section.
Saving: When the user completes the process, the current object moves to centers, and current is cleared.
New Centers: Selecting “New damage center” resets the form and assigns the next sequential number. The same process repeats.
Editing/Deleting: A dropdown on the first page lists all centers from centers; selecting one loads it into the wizard for editing or deletion.
Final Summary: The last page shows a collapsible summary for each damage center, listing its location, totals for works/parts/repairs, totals without VAT, and totals with VAT. It then aggregates totals across all centers.
5. Parts Search
The parts search is handled by an external module. It is not a core part of the wizard. The wizard listens for webhook responses with part suggestions (stored under parts_search). These suggestions populate a parts search field (e.g. an iframe) where users type to find parts, independent of the damage center helper.
