# Task Management RLS Fix - SOLVED

## ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Root Cause Discovered
The supabaseClient.js was **always using the ANON key** instead of the user's access_token when making authenticated requests. This caused `auth.uid()` to return NULL in RLS policy context, blocking all authenticated operations.

### The Fix
Updated `/home/user/SmartVal/lib/supabaseClient.js` (lines 119-151) to:
1. Check sessionStorage for user's auth session
2. Extract the access_token from session data
3. Use that token in the Authorization header
4. Fall back to anon key only when not logged in

**Before:**
```javascript
buildRequestOptions() {
  const options = {
    method: this.method,
    headers: {
      'apikey': supabaseAnonKey,
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${supabaseAnonKey}`,  // ❌ Always anon key
      ...
    }
  };
  return options;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
buildRequestOptions() {
  // Get auth token from session storage if available
  let authToken = supabaseAnonKey;
  try {
    const authData = sessionStorage.getItem('auth');
    if (authData) {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(authData);
      if (parsed.session && parsed.session.access_token) {
        authToken = parsed.session.access_token;  // ✅ Use user's token
      }
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Could not read auth session, using anon key:', e);
  }

  const options = {
    method: this.method,
    headers: {
      'apikey': supabaseAnonKey,
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${authToken}`,  // ✅ User token when logged in
      ...
    }
  };
  return options;
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the JavaScript Fix
The fix is in branch: `claude/fix-auth-rls-011CUPWtuYwx2F1d8wHf377p`

**Merge this branch to main** and deploy to production (Netlify).

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Browser
After deployment, **all users must hard refresh** their browsers (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) to load the fixed JavaScript.

### Step 3: Re-enable RLS
Once the fix is deployed and you've hard refreshed, run this SQL script in Supabase:
```
/supabase migration/task-management-system/sql/17_reenable_rls_with_auth_fix.sql
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Verify auth.uid() is working (should show your user ID and role)
2. ✅ Drop all existing conflicting policies
3. ✅ Create proper role-based policies for all tables
4. ✅ Re-enable RLS on all 5 task tables
5. ✅ Display verification queries to confirm everything works

### Step 4: Test Thoroughly
After running the script:
1. Test as **admin** - should see all tasks, create any task
2. Test as **developer** - should see all tasks, create any task
3. Test as **assistant** - should see own tasks + tasks they created, create tasks for self/assessors
4. Test as **assessor** - should only see own tasks, create tasks only for self

## 📋 Current Status

**RLS**: Currently DISABLED (emergency measure)
**Auth Fix**: ✅ DEPLOYED to branch `claude/fix-auth-rls-011CUPWtuYwx2F1d8wHf377p`
**Ready to Secure**: YES - after merging branch and running script 17

## 🔐 Security Model

Once RLS is re-enabled, the system will have proper role-based access control:

### Admin / Developer
- ✅ Full access to all tasks
- ✅ Can create tasks for anyone
- ✅ Can update any task
- ✅ Can delete any task

### Assistant
- ✅ Can view tasks assigned TO them OR assigned BY them
- ✅ Can create tasks for themselves or for assessors
- ✅ Can update their own assigned tasks
- ❌ Cannot see other assistants' tasks
- ❌ Cannot delete tasks

### Assessor
- ✅ Can view only tasks assigned to them
- ✅ Can create tasks only for themselves
- ✅ Can update their own assigned tasks
- ❌ Cannot see other users' tasks
- ❌ Cannot delete tasks

## 🎯 Next Action

1. **Merge PR** for branch `claude/fix-auth-rls-011CUPWtuYwx2F1d8wHf377p`
2. **Deploy to Netlify** (should be automatic after merge)
3. **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Run SQL script 17** to re-enable RLS with proper security
5. **Test all user roles** to verify access control works

## ✅ Success Criteria

After completing the steps above:
- [ ] auth.uid() returns correct user ID (not NULL)
- [ ] Admin can see all tasks
- [ ] Assistant can see only their tasks
- [ ] Assessor can see only their tasks
- [ ] Task creation works for all roles
- [ ] RLS is enabled on all 5 task tables
- [ ] No 401 or 403 errors when creating/viewing tasks
