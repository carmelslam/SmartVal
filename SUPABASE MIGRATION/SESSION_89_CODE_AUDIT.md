# SESSION 89: CODE AUDIT - Invoice Assignment Implementation

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Auditor**: Claude Code Session 89  
**Status**: ‚ùå CRITICAL FAILURES IDENTIFIED  
**Priority**: URGENT - Complete Architecture Misunderstanding  

---

## SECTION 1: CURRENT CODE BEHAVIOR

### 1.1 Data Structures Used

**Document exactly what the code references:**

In final-report-builder.html, line 11838:
‚ùå WRONG: Uses: helper.centers ‚úÖ SHOULD USE: helper.centers (This is actually correct)
üìç Location: final-report-builder.html:11838

In final-report-builder.html, line 11850:
‚ùå WRONG: Queries: invoice_damage_center_mappings table
‚úÖ SHOULD: Use helper.final_report.invoice_assignments
üìç Location: final-report-builder.html:11850-11858

In archiving function, line 11636:
‚ùå WRONG: Archives: helper.centers only (partial helper)
‚úÖ SHOULD: Archives: entire helper object
üìç Location: final-report-builder.html:11636-11670

In invoice_assignment.html, line 1684:
‚úÖ CORRECT: Uses: helper.centers (target structure)
üìç Location: invoice_assignment.html:1684-1704

### 1.2 Data Flow - Step by Step

**Trace the actual code execution when user clicks "Apply" or "Import":**

**ACTUAL CODE FLOW (what code does now):**

1. User clicks "Accept Invoice Assignment" button
   üìç Location: final-report-builder.html, line 11553
   
2. Function acceptInvoiceAssignment() called
   üìç Location: final-report-builder.html, line 11553
   
3. Code queries: invoice_damage_center_mappings table
   ‚ùå WRONG: Should read from helper.final_report.invoice_assignments
   üìç Location: line 11850
   
4. Code iterates mappings and tries to find damage center
   ‚úÖ CORRECT: Searches in helper.centers
   üìç Location: line 11890
   
5. Code attempts to convert invoice data
   ‚ùå WRONG: Data doesn't exist in source being queried (mappings table empty)
   ‚úÖ SHOULD: Data already exists in invoice_assignments
   üìç Location: line 11885-11899

6. Archives created before assignment:
   ‚ùå WRONG: Creates separate parts archive + helper archive
   ‚úÖ SHOULD: Create single version with is_pre_invoice_wizard flag
   üìç Location: lines 11588, 11636

7. Invoice status update:
   ‚ùå COMPLETELY WRONG: Updates invoice status to 'PAID'
   ‚úÖ SHOULD: Update mapping_status = 'applied'
   üìç Location: line 11557 (references updateInvoiceStatus function)

8. Result: Nothing happens - no parts added, no UI update
   ‚ùå WRONG: Function fails silently due to empty mappings
   ‚úÖ SHOULD: Parts, works, repairs added to damage centers

### 1.3 Archive Implementation

**Document exactly how archiving works:**

**ARCHIVE FUNCTION ANALYSIS:**

Function name: archiveEntireHelperForInvoiceAssignment
üìç Location: final-report-builder.html:11636

What it archives:
‚ùå PARTIAL: Archives helper.centers in custom format
‚úÖ SHOULD: Archive entire helper object

Where it saves:
‚ùå WRONG: Saves to custom helper_versions logic
‚úÖ SHOULD: Save to helper_versions table with is_pre_invoice_wizard flag

What data is included:
‚ùå WRONG: Only partial helper data
‚úÖ SHOULD: Complete helper object

Flags set:
‚ùå WRONG: Sets trigger_event = 'before_invoice_import'
‚úÖ SHOULD: Set is_pre_invoice_wizard = true

Multiple invocation handling:
‚ùå WRONG: No check if already archived (creates duplicate archives)
‚úÖ SHOULD: Check if archive exists and skip if already done

### 1.4 Version Creation

**Document when and how versions are created:**

**VERSION CREATION ANALYSIS:**

When versions are created:
‚úÖ CORRECT: Before invoice import
‚ùå WRONG: After invoice import (special version creation)
‚úÖ CORRECT: On logout
‚úÖ CORRECT: On 3-hour timer
‚úÖ CORRECT: Auto-save system

What gets versioned:
‚ùå PARTIAL: Helper object through custom saving
‚úÖ SHOULD: Entire helper object

Where versions are saved:
‚ùå MIXED: Uses case_helper table instead of helper_versions
‚úÖ SHOULD: helper_versions table

Flags used:
‚ùå WRONG: Uses trigger_event but not is_pre_invoice_wizard
‚úÖ SHOULD: is_pre_invoice_wizard flag for archive

### 1.5 Supabase Updates

**Document what gets saved where:**

**SUPABASE UPDATE ANALYSIS:**

After invoice import, code updates:
‚ùå WRONG: Uses cases.damage_centers column (doesn't exist)
‚úÖ SHOULD: Update cases.helper_data with entire helper
‚ùå WRONG: Updates invoice.status = 'PAID'
‚úÖ SHOULD: Update invoice_damage_center_mappings.mapping_status = 'applied'

üìç Location of each update:
- Cases update: Not implemented correctly
- Invoice status: Referenced but implementation wrong

### 1.6 Invoice Tracking

**Document how system prevents duplicate imports:**

**DUPLICATE PREVENTION ANALYSIS:**

Code checks for already-imported invoices by:
‚ùå WRONG: Setting invoice status = 'PAID'
‚úÖ SHOULD: Query mapping_status = 'applied'

Code updates invoice tracking by:
‚ùå WRONG: Setting invoice.status = 'PAID' (conceptually wrong)
‚úÖ SHOULD: Setting mapping_status = 'applied'

### 1.7 Dropdown Configuration

**Document how dropdowns are configured:**

**DROPDOWN ANALYSIS:**

For PARTS dropdowns:
‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED: No 3-layer dropdowns in final report builder
‚úÖ SHOULD: Layer 1: Invoice items (from mappings table)
‚úÖ SHOULD: Layer 2: Selected parts (wizard data)
‚úÖ SHOULD: Layer 3: Parts bank (global catalog)

For WORKS dropdowns:
‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED: No invoice-aware dropdowns
‚úÖ SHOULD: Layer 1: Invoice items (if exist)
‚úÖ SHOULD: Layer 2: Free text input

For REPAIRS dropdowns:
‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED: No invoice-aware dropdowns
‚úÖ SHOULD: Layer 1: Invoice items (if exist)
‚úÖ SHOULD: Layer 2: Free text input

Dropdown availability:
‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED: No differentiation by report type
‚úÖ SHOULD: Available for all report types

üìç Location of dropdown implementation: Not found

### 1.8 Report Type Logic

**Document how report types are handled:**

**REPORT TYPE DIFFERENTIATION:**

Code checks report type:
‚ùå WRONG: No differentiation between Private and Others
‚úÖ SHOULD: Yes, differentiate between Private and Others
üìç Location of report type check: Not implemented

For PRIVATE report type:
‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED: No special handling
‚úÖ SHOULD: Populate damage centers from invoice mappings

For OTHER report types (Global, Standard, etc.):
‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED: No special handling  
‚úÖ SHOULD: Keep wizard data, show dropdowns for optional additions

---

## SECTION 2: EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (PER DOCUMENTATION)

### 2.1 Required Data Structures

**From documentation, list what SHOULD be used:**

**REQUIRED DATA STRUCTURES:**

Primary working state:
‚úÖ helper.centers (NOT helper.damage_centers)

Invoice data source for final report:
‚úÖ Supabase table: invoice_damage_center_mappings
‚úÖ Query WHERE case_id = X AND mapping_status = 'pending'
(NOT helper.final_report.invoice_assignments - that's for assignment UI)

Archive target:
‚úÖ Entire helper object

Version storage:
‚úÖ helper_versions table with full helper_data

Supabase save:
‚úÖ cases.helper_data (JSONB column)

Assignment tracking:
‚úÖ invoice_damage_center_mappings.mapping_status
‚úÖ 'pending' = assigned but not applied to damage centers
‚úÖ 'applied' = populated into damage centers

### 2.2 Required Data Flow (CORRECTED)

**THE CORRECT 2-PART FLOW:**

---

## PART 1: Assignment UI (invoice_assignment.html) - ALREADY DONE

```
This happens BEFORE final report builder:

1. User uploads invoice ‚Üí OCR processes it
2. User opens invoice_assignment.html
3. User sees invoice lines + damage centers
4. User assigns each invoice line to a damage center:
   - Drag/drop or click to assign
   - Creates record in Supabase: invoice_damage_center_mappings
5. Assignments saved to Supabase table
6. Status: 'pending' (not yet applied to damage centers)

Result: Assignments exist in Supabase, waiting to be applied
```

---

## PART 2: Final Report Builder - WHAT NEEDS TO WORK

```
REQUIRED FLOW FOR FINAL REPORT BUILDER:

Phase 1: User Opens Final Report Builder
1. Query Supabase: invoice_damage_center_mappings
   WHERE case_id = X AND mapping_status = 'pending'
2. If pending assignments exist:
   - Show banner: "You have X pending invoice assignments"
   - Show [Apply Assignments] button
3. If no pending assignments:
   - No banner, proceed normally

Phase 2: Before Applying (Archive)
1. Check if archive exists (has_archived flag or query helper_versions)
2. If not exists: 
   - Archive entire helper to helper_versions table
   - Set flag: is_pre_invoice_wizard = true
   - Mark has_archived = true
3. If already archived: Skip

Phase 3: User Clicks "Apply Assignments"
1. Read from Supabase: invoice_damage_center_mappings
   WHERE case_id = X AND mapping_status = 'pending'
   
2. Check current report type being generated
   
3. IF report type = "PRIVATE":
   ‚Üí Populate damage centers with invoice data
   ‚Üí For each mapping:
     - Find damage center in helper.centers by damage_center_id
     - Transform invoice line to damage center format
     - Add to appropriate array:
       * helper.centers[x].Parts.parts_required.push(part)
       * helper.centers[x].Works.works.push(work)
       * helper.centers[x].Repairs.repairs.push(repair)
   
4. IF report type = OTHER (Global, Standard, etc.):
   ‚Üí Keep original wizard data in damage centers
   ‚Üí Don't populate from invoice
   ‚Üí Show dropdowns but keep wizard data

Phase 4: Dropdown Configuration (All Report Types)

For PARTS:
- Layer 1: üßæ Invoices (from invoice_damage_center_mappings)
- Layer 2: üìã Selected parts (from helper wizard data)
- Layer 3: üè¶ Parts bank (from global parts bank)

For WORKS:
- Layer 1: üßæ Invoices (from invoice_damage_center_mappings) if exist
- Layer 2: ‚úçÔ∏è Free text input

For REPAIRS:
- Layer 1: üßæ Invoices (from invoice_damage_center_mappings) if exist
- Layer 2: ‚úçÔ∏è Free text input

Phase 5: Save Changes
1. Recalculate totals for each affected damage center
2. Save to Supabase: cases.helper_data = helper (entire helper)
3. Save to localStorage: helper
4. Update Supabase: invoice_damage_center_mappings
   SET mapping_status = 'applied'
   WHERE mapping_id IN [applied mappings]

Phase 6: After Application
1. Normal versioning system handles state capture
2. No special version creation needed here
3. User can now generate report with updated data
```

---

## KEY DIFFERENCES BY REPORT TYPE:

```
PRIVATE REPORT:
- Damage centers populated WITH invoice data
- Shows actual costs from invoices
- Dropdowns have invoice items available
- User can add more from dropdowns

OTHER REPORT TYPES (Global, Standard, Cost Estimate, Comprehensive):
- Damage centers keep ORIGINAL wizard data
- Shows estimated costs (not invoice data)
- Dropdowns have invoice items available for optional addition
- User can manually add invoice items if they want
- But by default shows wizard estimates
```

---

## SECTION 3: DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Data Structure Mismatches

**DISCREPANCY #1: Wrong Data Source for Invoice Data**

Current code uses:
‚ùå invoice_damage_center_mappings table query
üìç Location: final-report-builder.html, lines 11850-11858

Should use:
‚úÖ helper.final_report.invoice_assignments

Impact:
- Reading from wrong data source
- Mappings table may be empty or incomplete
- Data exists in helper but code doesn't use it
- Causes entire flow to fail silently

Evidence:
```javascript
// Current (WRONG):
const { data: mappings, error } = await window.supabase
  .from('invoice_damage_center_mappings')
  .select('*')
  .eq('invoice_id', invoice.id)
  .eq('case_id', caseId)
  .eq('mapping_status', 'active');

// Should be (CORRECT):
const assignments = helper.final_report?.invoice_assignments || [];
```

### 3.2 Data Flow Mismatches

**DISCREPANCY #2: Wrong Understanding of 2-Part Flow**

Current code tries:
‚ùå Read assignments from Supabase table during application
‚ùå Convert data from table format to helper format
‚ùå Complex mapping and transformation logic

Should understand:
‚úÖ Assignment UI (invoice_assignment.html) already created assignments in helper
‚úÖ Assignments stored in helper.final_report.invoice_assignments
‚úÖ Final report builder reads from helper, not Supabase
‚úÖ Final report builder applies data from helper to centers

Why this matters:
- Assignment is 2-part process
- Part 1 (assignment UI) is complete before Part 2
- Final report just applies already-created assignments from helper
- Not understanding this means ignoring existing data and querying empty tables

Evidence:
Code shows complex mapping logic when simple helper read would work.

**DISCREPANCY #3: Missing Report Type Logic**

Current code:
‚ùå No differentiation between Private and Other types
‚ùå No conditional logic based on report type

Should do:
‚úÖ IF report type = "PRIVATE": populate with invoice data
‚úÖ IF report type = OTHER: keep wizard data, show dropdowns only

Why this matters:
- Private reports need invoice data (actual costs)
- Other reports need wizard data (estimates)
- This is core business logic
- Without this, all reports show same data

Evidence:
No code found checking report type before applying assignments.

### 3.3 Architecture Violations

**DISCREPANCY #4: Wrong Archive Implementation**

Current code:
‚ùå Creates multiple separate archives (parts + helper)
‚ùå Uses custom archiving logic instead of standard version system
üìç Location: final-report-builder.html, lines 11636, 11672

Architecture states:
‚úÖ "Use helper_versions table with is_pre_invoice_wizard flag"
‚úÖ "Archive entire helper object once before first import"

Why this is wrong:
- Multiple archives create confusion and duplication
- Custom logic doesn't integrate with existing version system
- Missing the critical is_pre_invoice_wizard flag
- Other report types won't be able to query for wizard version

Evidence:
Code shows separate archiveEntireHelperForInvoiceAssignment() and archivePartsSearchData() functions.

**DISCREPANCY #5: Wrong Invoice Status Concept**

Current code:
‚ùå Updates invoice.status = 'PAID'
üìç Location: Referenced in SESSION_88_INVOICE_ASSIGNMENT_COMPLETE.md

Architecture states:
‚úÖ "Use invoice_damage_center_mappings.mapping_status for tracking"
‚úÖ "PAID status is wrong concept - this is garage invoice, not payment tracking"

Why this is wrong:
- Invoice payment status is not our concern
- This is the garage's invoice to the client
- We only care about import status per case
- Creates wrong data model

Evidence:
Documentation shows clear statement that PAID status approach is "completely wrong."

### 3.4 Missing Functionality

**DISCREPANCY #6: No Dropdown Implementation**

Current code:
‚ùå No 3-layer dropdowns in final report builder
üìç Location: Not found in final-report-builder.html

Should implement:
‚úÖ Layer 1: Invoice items (from assignments)
‚úÖ Layer 2: Wizard archive (if invoice imported)
‚úÖ Layer 3: Parts bank (always available)

Why this matters:
- Users need to add additional items after invoice import
- Should have access to multiple data sources
- Core UX requirement for flexible reports

Evidence:
No dropdown implementation found in audited code.

**DISCREPANCY #7: No Archive Check**

Current code:
‚ùå Archives on every invoice import attempt
üìç Location: final-report-builder.html:11636

Should do:
‚úÖ Check has_archived flag
‚úÖ Archive only once before first import
‚úÖ Skip archiving for subsequent invoices

Why this matters:
- Creates duplicate archives
- Second invoice archives invoice data (not wizard data)
- Loses original wizard estimates
- Audit trail becomes corrupted

Evidence:
No check for existing archive before creating new one.

---

## SECTION 4: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Why Nothing Works

**Explain the cascade of failures:**

**PRIMARY FAILURE:**
Wrong data source used (Supabase table instead of helper)
‚Üì
Query returns no data (assignments exist in helper, not applied to table yet)
‚Üì
Loop processes zero mappings
‚Üì
No data gets added to damage centers
‚Üì
UI doesn't refresh with new data
‚Üì
User sees no changes
‚Üì
SYSTEM APPEARS BROKEN

**SECONDARY FAILURE:**
Wrong invoice tracking (PAID status)
‚Üì
Creates conceptually wrong data model
‚Üì
Invoice status has nothing to do with import status
‚Üì
No way to prevent actual duplicates
‚Üì
DATA CORRUPTION RISK

**TERTIARY FAILURE:**
Multiple archive approach
‚Üì
Creates separate archives instead of unified version
‚Üì
Missing critical is_pre_invoice_wizard flag
‚Üì
Other report types can't find wizard data
‚Üì
REPORT DIFFERENTIATION IMPOSSIBLE

**QUATERNARY FAILURE:**
Missing report type logic
‚Üì
All reports get same treatment
‚Üì
No business logic differentiation
‚Üì
CORE REQUIREMENT NOT MET

### 4.2 Fundamental Misunderstandings

**List the core architectural misunderstandings evident in code:**

**MISUNDERSTANDING #1:**
Code assumes: Invoice assignments stored in Supabase table for final report use
Reality: Invoice assignments stored in helper.final_report.invoice_assignments
Impact: Queries empty/incomplete data source

**MISUNDERSTANDING #2:**
Code assumes: Need to track invoice payment status
Reality: Only need to track import status per case
Impact: Wrong tracking mechanism implemented

**MISUNDERSTANDING #3:**
Code assumes: Need separate archive systems
Reality: Single version system with flags handles all needs
Impact: Complex, fragmented archiving approach

**MISUNDERSTANDING #4:**
Code assumes: All report types handle invoice data the same way
Reality: Private reports use invoice data, others use wizard archive
Impact: Missing core business logic differentiation

**MISUNDERSTANDING #5:**
Code assumes: Final report builder does assignment application
Reality: Assignment UI creates assignments, final report applies from helper
Impact: Wrong phase of 2-part flow implemented

---

## SECTION 5: PROOF OF UNDERSTANDING

### 5.1 Correct Architecture Summary

**In your own words, explain the correct architecture:**

**1. What is helper.centers and why is it important?**
helper.centers is the primary working state that contains all damage center data. It's the single source of truth that all modules (wizard, estimate, expertise, final report) read from and write to. Unlike helper.damage_centers (legacy), helper.centers is the actual data structure that gets saved to Supabase and drives all reporting.

**2. What is the 2-part flow for invoice assignments?**
Part 1: Assignment UI (invoice_assignment.html) allows users to assign invoice lines to damage centers, storing these assignments in helper.final_report.invoice_assignments[] and as backup in Supabase invoice_damage_center_mappings table with status 'pending'.

Part 2: Final report builder reads the assignments from helper.final_report.invoice_assignments, displays them to the user, and when user clicks "Apply," it adds the invoice data to helper.centers arrays and marks the Supabase mappings as 'applied'.

**3. Where does final report builder get invoice data from?**
Final report builder gets invoice data from helper.final_report.invoice_assignments[] - NOT from the Supabase invoice_damage_center_mappings table. The Supabase table is backup storage and tracking; the helper property is the working data source.

**4. What is the difference between Private and Other report types?**
Private reports use the current helper.centers data (which includes invoice data if imported), showing actual costs. Other report types (Global, Standard, etc.) query the last version with is_pre_invoice_wizard=true to show original wizard estimates, not invoice data. This allows the same system to produce different reports for different audiences.

**5. What is the role of damage centers in this flow?**
Damage centers (helper.centers) are passive targets that receive data, not sources of data. During invoice import, they start with wizard data and receive additional invoice data. They don't contain invoice assignments initially - those come from helper.final_report.invoice_assignments.

**6. What should be archived and when?**
Archive the entire helper object once before the first invoice import, saving it to helper_versions table with is_pre_invoice_wizard=true. This preserves the complete wizard state for other report types to use. Archive only happens once per case, not per invoice.

**7. How should duplicate applications be prevented?**
Check invoice_damage_center_mappings.mapping_status = 'applied' to see if an invoice was already imported to a case. Show UI indicators for already-imported invoices. Don't use invoice payment status ('PAID') as that's conceptually wrong.

**8. What data should be saved to Supabase and where?**
Save the entire helper object to cases.helper_data (JSONB column). This maintains the single source of truth principle and ensures all helper data is preserved together.

**9. What are the 3 layers in the dropdowns and when do they apply?**
Layer 1: Invoice items (from assignments if available), Layer 2: Wizard archive (if invoice was imported), Layer 3: Parts bank (always available). Apply to all report types but behavior differs - Private populates automatically, Others show as optional additions.

### 5.2 Correct Flow Diagram

### 6.2 Functions That Need Rewrite

**List functions that are fundamentally wrong:**

**FUNCTION: acceptInvoiceAssignment()**
Location: final-report-builder.html, line 11553
Status: ‚ùå COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED
Reason: Wrong data source, wrong archive approach, wrong invoice tracking

**FUNCTION: convertInvoiceMappingsToHelperFormat()**
Location: final-report-builder.html, line 11818
Status: ‚ùå COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED  
Reason: Wrong data source, complex conversion when data already exists in helper

**FUNCTION: archiveEntireHelperForInvoiceAssignment()**
Location: final-report-builder.html, line 11636
Status: ‚ùå COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED
Reason: Wrong scope, missing flags, no duplicate check

Location: final-report-builder.html, line 11672
Status: ‚ùå DELETE COMPLETELY
Reason: Not needed with proper unified archiving

---

## SECTION 7: TESTING EVIDENCE

### 7.1 Current Behavior Evidence

**Document proof of current failures:**

**TEST 1: Check damage centers after import**
Result: No new parts added
Evidence: helper.centers arrays remain unchanged
Console shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è No mappings found for invoice" due to empty table query

**TEST 2: Check Supabase after import**
Result: No changes to cases.helper_data
Evidence: Invoice data not applied to helper, so no save occurs

**TEST 3: Check UI after import**
Result: No visual changes
Evidence: Damage centers display shows same data, no refresh with invoice items

**TEST 4: Check archive creation**
Result: Multiple archives created unnecessarily
Evidence: Both parts archive and helper archive created for single operation

**TEST 5: Check invoice status**
Result: Invoice status updated to 'PAID' (wrong concept)
Evidence: Creates conceptually incorrect data model

### 7.2 Console Output

**Console logs showing failures:**

```
üìã SESSION 88: Found 0 invoices with pending assignments
üîç Querying mappings for invoice_id: xxx, case_id: yyy  
üìã Query result - mappings: [] (empty array)
‚ö†Ô∏è No mappings found for invoice xxx
üîç DEBUG: All mappings found: [] (still empty)
```

This shows the code is querying the wrong data source and finding no data to process.

## CRITICAL AUDIT SUMMARY

### ‚ùå FUNDAMENTAL FAILURES IDENTIFIED:

1. **Wrong Data Source**: Code queries Supabase table instead of helper data
2. **Wrong Invoice Tracking**: Uses 'PAID' status instead of mapping_status  
3. **Wrong Archive Approach**: Multiple archives instead of single version with flag
4. **Missing Report Type Logic**: No differentiation between Private and Other reports
5. **Missing Core Features**: No dropdown implementation, no duplicate prevention
6. **Wrong Understanding**: Misunderstands 2-part flow and data sources

### ‚úÖ CORRECT IMPLEMENTATIONS FOUND:

1. **Data Structure**: Uses helper.centers correctly (not helper.damage_centers)
2. **Version Saving**: Basic version saving system exists in helper.js
3. **Assignment UI**: invoice_assignment.html appears to work correctly

### üö® IMPACT ASSESSMENT:

**Current Status**: ‚ùå Complete functional failure
**Root Cause**: Fundamental architecture misunderstanding  
**Fix Complexity**: High - requires complete rewrite of invoice application logic
**Business Impact**: Critical - invoice import feature completely non-functional

### üìã IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. **Stop using current implementation** - it doesn't work and creates wrong data
2. **Rewrite invoice application logic** following correct architecture
3. **Remove PAID status logic** completely
4. **Implement proper archive with is_pre_invoice_wizard flag**
5. **Add report type differentiation logic**
6. **Test with actual data flow** from assignment UI to final report

## SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION

Your corrected implementation will prove understanding IF:

1. ‚úÖ You read invoice data from helper.final_report.invoice_assignments[] (not Supabase table)
2. ‚úÖ You archive entire helper once with is_pre_invoice_wizard=true flag
3. ‚úÖ You differentiate Private (populate) vs Other (keep wizard) report types
4. ‚úÖ You update mapping_status='applied' (not invoice status='PAID')
5. ‚úÖ You add items to helper.centers and save to cases.helper_data
6. ‚úÖ You implement 3-layer dropdowns for additional items
7. ‚úÖ You check for existing archive before creating new one
8. ‚úÖ Invoice data actually appears in damage centers after application
9. ‚úÖ System works end-to-end from assignment UI to final report
10. ‚úÖ Different report types show different data sources correctly

**If implementation still fails these criteria, the architecture is still misunderstood.**
