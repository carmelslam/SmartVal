# SESSION 5: RECOVERY & SYSTEMATIC DIAGNOSTICS
**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: DIAGNOSTIC PHASE

## WHAT I'VE DONE SO FAR

### 1. Created Phase-Based SQL Organization
```
/supabase/sql/
├── Phase1_Foundation/          (for Phase 1 SQL files)
├── Phase2_DualWrite/           (for Phase 2 SQL files)
├── Phase3_Realtime/            (for Phase 3 SQL files)
├── Phase4_Parts_Search_2025-10-05/  ← CURRENT WORK HERE
├── Unassigned_SQL/             (all 215 existing SQL - starting point)
└── Obsolete_Archive/           (for broken/obsolete SQL)
```

**What Happened**: 
- Moved all 215 SQL files to `Unassigned_SQL/` folder
- As we work on each issue, we'll move relevant SQL to appropriate phase folders
- This way we track which SQL is working, broken, or obsolete

### 2. Created Comprehensive Diagnostic SQL
**File**: `DIAGNOSTIC_COMPLETE_STATE_2025-10-05.sql`

This diagnostic checks:
- ✅ Search function existence and signature
- ✅ Triggers on catalog_items table
- ✅ Data quality metrics
- ✅ **Word order in part descriptions** (your issue #1)
- ✅ **Year reversal patterns** (your issue #2)
- ✅ **Source field Hebrew reversal** (your issue #4)
- ✅ Search functionality (simple, advanced, cascade)
- ✅ Sample actual results for inspection

### 3. Updated Task File
Added Session 5 documentation to:
`/supabase migration/supbase and parts search module integration.md`

## WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW

### STEP 1: Run the Diagnostic
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of: `Phase4_Parts_Search_2025-10-05/DIAGNOSTIC_COMPLETE_STATE_2025-10-05.sql`
3. Run it
4. **Copy ALL results** (all 8 sections)
5. Paste results back to me

### STEP 2: I Will Analyze
Once I get the results, I will:
- Identify root cause of each issue
- Create targeted fix SQL for each problem
- Give you ONE fix at a time to deploy & test

### STEP 3: Fix → Test → Document Loop
For each issue:
1. I create the fix SQL
2. You deploy it in Supabase
3. You test and tell me the result
4. I document what worked/broke in the task file
5. Move to next issue

## CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX (from your report)

1. ❌ Part description showing backwards word order
2. ❌ Year showing reversed (810 instead of 018)
3. ❌ Year range not showing in UI (2020 instead of 018-020)
4. ❌ Source field sometimes reversed Hebrew
5. ❌ Advanced search not working properly
6. ❌ Search doesn't handle synonyms/abbreviations

## DOCUMENTATION PROMISE

Every action will be logged in the task file with:
- **Date & Version**: When it was done
- **Task Purpose**: What we were trying to fix
- **Logic & Principles**: Why this approach should work
- **SQL File Name**: Exact file used
- **Actual Result**: What you reported after testing
- **Status**: WORKED or BROKE

This way, the next Claude session can pick up EXACTLY where we left off.

## READY TO PROCEED?

Just run the diagnostic and send me the results. I'll analyze and start fixing issues one by one.
