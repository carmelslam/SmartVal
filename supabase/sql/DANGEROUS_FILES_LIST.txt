⚠️ WARNING: DANGEROUS SQL FILES THAT DELETE DATA ⚠️

DO NOT RUN THESE FILES - They contain DELETE FROM catalog_items statements:

1. simple_batch_process.sql - DELETES catalog data
2. fix_trigger_test.sql - DELETES test data from catalog
3. reinstall_automatic_triggers.sql - DELETES test records
4. batch_process_fixed.sql - DELETES catalog data
5. automatic_extraction_trigger.sql - DELETES test data

SAFE FILES TO RUN:

✅ SAFE_SEARCH_DEPLOYMENT.sql - Only creates search functions
✅ CHECK_CATALOG_DATA.sql - Only reads data
✅ DEPLOY_ESSENTIAL_FUNCTIONS.sql - Only creates functions

PARTIALLY SAFE (check before running):

⚠️ DROP_AND_REDEPLOY_ALL.sql - Drops functions but NOT data
⚠️ AUTOMATIC_DEPLOYMENT_SYSTEM.sql - Creates triggers but does NOT delete data

IMPORTANT: Always check SQL files for DELETE, TRUNCATE, or DROP TABLE statements before running!
