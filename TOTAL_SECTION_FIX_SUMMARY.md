# Total Section Data Persistence Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Total section data in final-report-builder.html was not persisting to helper on refresh. Edits and additional fields in the Total section were being deleted from UI and helper.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Root Cause #1: reloadGrossAdjustments Function
- Was clearing ALL final_report.adjustments data
- This included Total section data (mileage, ownership_type, ownership_history, additional)
- Should have only cleared Gross section data (features, registration)

### 2. Root Cause #2: loadTotalValueSectionAdjustments Function
- Was loading data from estimate.adjustments and valuation.adjustments
- Was NOT loading from final_report.adjustments where manual additions are saved
- This caused all manual additions to be lost on page refresh

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed reloadGrossAdjustments
```javascript
// Before: Cleared everything
helper.final_report.adjustments = {
  features: [],
  registration: [],
  mileage: [],
  ownership_type: [],
  ownership_history: [],
  usage: [],
  additional: []
};

// After: Only clears Gross section, preserves Total section
const preservedData = {
  mileage: helper.final_report.adjustments.mileage || [],
  ownership_type: helper.final_report.adjustments.ownership_type || [],
  ownership_history: helper.final_report.adjustments.ownership_history || [],
  usage: helper.final_report.adjustments.usage || [],
  additional: helper.final_report.adjustments.additional || []
};
helper.final_report.adjustments.features = [];
helper.final_report.adjustments.registration = [];
Object.assign(helper.final_report.adjustments, preservedData);
```

### 2. Fixed loadTotalValueSectionAdjustments
Changed loading priority for all Total section categories:
- **Before**: estimate.adjustments → valuation.adjustments
- **After**: final_report.adjustments → estimate.adjustments → valuation.adjustments

This ensures manual additions are loaded first, with proper fallbacks.

## Data Flow Summary

### Gross Section (Features & Registration)
- **Save**: UI → final_report.adjustments → valuation.adjustments
- **Load**: final_report.adjustments (synced with Gross section)
- **Reload Button**: Clears and reloads from estimate.adjustments

### Total Section (Mileage, Ownership, Additional, etc.)
- **Save**: UI → final_report.adjustments → valuation.adjustments (original rows only)
- **Load**: final_report.adjustments → estimate.adjustments → valuation.adjustments
- **Reload Button**: Preserves manual additions in features/registration

## Testing Recommendations
1. Add manual adjustments to Total section
2. Refresh the page - verify data persists
3. Click "טען התאמות לוי יצחק" in Gross section - verify Total section data remains
4. Add more adjustments and save - verify all data persists

## Result
Total section manual additions and edits now persist correctly across page refreshes while maintaining compatibility with reload buttons and proper data synchronization between sections.
