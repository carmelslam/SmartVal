IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (9 tasks, 16 hours):
Task 1: ✅ Database Schema (1 hour) - COMPLETE
Task 2: ⏳ Invoice Service (2 hours)
Task 3: ⏳ Upload Integration (2 hours)
Task 4: ⏳ Floating Screen (3 hours)
Task 5: ⏳ Helper Sync (1.5 hours)
Task 6: ⏳ Suggestive Logic (2 hours)
Task 7: ⏳ Search (1.5 hours)
Task 8: ⏳ Testing (2 hours)

HELPER STRUCTURE ANALYZED:
✅ window.helper.invoices[] - Simple array format
✅ window.helper.financials.invoices - Comprehensive format
✅ window.helper.financials.invoice_processing - Hebrew OCR format

ARCHITECTURE:
User Upload → invoice upload.html → Make.com OCR → Supabase
                                  ↓
                         invoice-service.js
                                  ↓
              ┌──────────────────┴──────────────────┐
              ↓                                     ↓
    Supabase Tables                        Helper Sync
    (5 tables)                          (bidirectional)
              ↓                                     ↓
    Invoice Floating Screen ←──────→ Final Report Builder
    (search, filter, approve)         (suggestive logic)

NEXT STEPS:
1. User reviews and approves plan
2. Deploy SQL migrations to Supabase
3. Begin Task 2: Create invoice-service.js
4. Continue implementation tasks 3-9
5. End-to-end testing
6. Mark Phase 5a complete

DEPENDENCIES:
✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Supabase setup, initial schema)
✅ Phase 6: Authentication (user tracking, RLS policies)
⏳ pg_trgm extension (for fuzzy search - needs to be enabled)

ESTIMATED COMPLETION:
16 hours = 2 working days (assuming 8 hours/day)

STATUS: Planning complete, awaiting approval to begin implementation
