error 1 : Understanding the problem

admin.html:4569 Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal return statement (at admin.html:4569:18)

Understanding the problem
This error indicates that a return statement is being used outside of a function body. The return statement is designed to exit a function and optionally return a value. It cannot be used in the global scope or directly within control flow structures like if or for loops unless those structures are inside a function.

Suggested fix
Wrap the return statement in a function. For example, if the return statement is currently at the top level of a script, it should be placed inside a function that is then called when needed.

js

// Original code (causing the error)
// ... some code ...
return; // Illegal return statement
// ... more code ...

// Corrected code
function myFunctionName() {
  // ... some code ...
  return; // Valid within a function
  // ... more code ...
}

myFunctionName(); // Call the function when needed
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error "Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal return statement" occurs when a return statement is used outside of a function. The fix is to ensure all return statements are located within a function body.


error 2 :
environment-config.js:398 ðŸ’¥ Error Report: 
{message: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')", filename: 'https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.js?v=2025070901', lineno: 28, colno: 21, error: 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (readingâ€¦-portal.netlify.app/admin.js?v=2025070901:122:64)', â€¦}
Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener') indicates that you are trying to call the addEventListener method on a variable or object that currently holds the value null. This usually happens when you try to select an HTML element using JavaScript, but the element with the specified selector is not found in the document.

How to verify
Identify the line number mentioned in the error (in this case, lineno: 28 in admin.js).
Look at the code on that line and the lines immediately preceding it to see what element is being selected and on what variable addEventListener is being called.
Inspect your HTML document to confirm if an element with the corresponding selector actually exists and is available in the DOM when that JavaScript code is executed.
Suggested fix
Ensure that the element you are trying to attach an event listener to exists in the DOM before you try to access it and call addEventListener. You can do this by checking if the element variable is not null before calling the method, or by ensuring your script runs after the DOM has been fully loaded.

Here's an example of how to add a check for the element's existence:

js

const myElement = document.getElementById('my-element-id'); // Replace with your actual selector

if (myElement) {
  myElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Your event handler code
  });
} else {
  console.error('Element with ID "my-element-id" not found.');
}
Use code snippets with caution

Alternatively, if your script is in the <head>, move it to the end of the <body> or wrap your code in a DOMContentLoaded listener:

js

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const myElement = document.getElementById('my-element-id');

  if (myElement) {
    myElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
      // Your event handler code
    });
  }
});
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener') occurs when you attempt to add an event listener to an element that was not found, resulting in a null value. To fix this, ensure the element exists in the DOM before attempting to add the listener, either by checking if the element variable is null or by running your script after the DOM is loaded.
