Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style') indicates that you are trying to access the style property of a variable or expression that currently holds the value null. This usually happens when you try to manipulate the style of an HTML element that doesn't exist or hasn't been found in the DOM.

The error report shows that this error occurred at line 3734 in the file https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.html.

The provided code for sendErrorReport is not the direct cause of the TypeError. This function is being called because the TypeError happened elsewhere in your code, likely within the admin.html file around line 3734, and your error reporting mechanism is catching and reporting it.

How to verify
Open your web application in Chrome.
Open DevTools and go to the "Elements" tab.
Examine the HTML structure of your page to confirm whether the element you are trying to access around line 3734 of your JavaScript code actually exists and has the expected ID, class, or tag name.
In the "Console" tab, click on the link next to the error message (https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.html:3734:19) to jump to the exact line of code where the error occurred. Inspect the variable or expression that is null right before the access to the .style property.
Suggested fix
The fix involves identifying the line of code around line 3734 where you are attempting to access the style property and ensuring that the element you are targeting actually exists before trying to manipulate its style.

Locate the code around line 3734 in your admin.html file (or a JavaScript file sourced by it). Look for code that tries to access an element, likely using methods like document.getElementById, document.querySelector, or similar.

Here's a common pattern and how to fix it:

js

// Original code (example - not your exact code):
const myElement = document.getElementById('some-id');
myElement.style.display = 'none'; // This line would throw the error if myElement is null

// Suggested fix: Add a check to ensure the element exists
const myElement = document.getElementById('some-id');
if (myElement) { // Check if the element was found
  myElement.style.display = 'none';
} else {
  console.warn("Element with ID 'some-id' not found."); // Optional: Log a warning
}

Use code snippets with caution

Apply this pattern to the specific line causing the error in your code.

Summary
The Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style') error means you are trying to access the style property of something that is null. This is likely because an HTML element you expected to find was not found in the DOM. To fix this, ensure the element exists before attempting to modify its style, typically by adding a check for null or undefined after retrieving the element.
error 2 :
admin.html:3734 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')
    at window.toggleSection (admin.html:3734:19)
    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (admin.html:1:1)
window.toggleSection	@	admin.html:3734
onclick	@	admin.html:1

Understanding the problem
The error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')" means that you are trying to access the style property of a variable that is currently null. In this case, the variable is likely the content variable, which is supposed to represent an HTML element. This happens when document.getElementById(sectionId + '-content') does not find an element with the specified ID, and thus returns null.

Suggested fix
Ensure that the HTML element with the ID constructed from sectionId + '-content' actually exists on the page before attempting to access its style property. You can add a check to see if the element was found:

js

// Collapsible Section Management
    window.toggleSection = function(sectionId) {
      const content = document.getElementById(sectionId + '-content');
      const icon = document.getElementById(sectionId + '-icon');

      // Add a check to ensure the element exists
      if (content) {
        if (content.style.display === 'none') {
          content.style.display = 'block';
          if (icon) { // Also check if the icon element exists
            icon.textContent = 'üîΩ';
          }
          sessionStorage.setItem(`section-${sectionId}`, 'expanded');
        } else {
          content.style.display = 'none';
          if (icon) { // Also check if the icon element exists
            icon.textContent = 'üîº';
          }
          sessionStorage.setItem(`section-${sectionId}`, 'collapsed');
        }
      } else {
        console.error(`Element with ID ${sectionId}-content not found.`);
      }
    };

Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error occurs because document.getElementById() returned null. The fix is to check if the element was found before trying to access its properties.

    diagnoseDataIssue() => 
    VM17353:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: diagnoseDataIssue is not defined
    at <anonymous>:1:3
(anonymous)	@	VM17353:1
Understanding the problem
This error means that the JavaScript engine tried to execute a function or variable named diagnoseDataIssue, but it couldn't find anything with that name in the current scope or anywhere in the accessible scopes. In simpler terms, you're trying to use something that hasn't been defined or declared.

Suggested fix
Ensure that the diagnoseDataIssue function is defined and accessible in the scope where you are trying to call it. This might involve:

Defining the function: If diagnoseDataIssue hasn't been defined yet, you need to write the function's code.
Checking scope: If the function is defined elsewhere, make sure it's not confined to a different scope (like inside another function) that isn't accessible from where you're calling it. You might need to declare it in a higher scope or pass it as an argument.
Checking script loading order: If the function is defined in a separate script file, ensure that script file is loaded before the code that tries to call diagnoseDataIssue.
Here's an example of how you might define a simple version of the function:

js

function diagnoseDataIssue() {
  // Your code to diagnose data issues goes here
  console.log("Diagnosing data issue...");
}

// Now you can call the function
diagnoseDataIssue();
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The Uncaught ReferenceError: diagnoseDataIssue is not defined error indicates that the JavaScript engine could not find a definition for diagnoseDataIssue. To fix this, ensure that the function is defined and accessible in the current scope.

forcePopulateFields()
VM17357:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: forcePopulateFields is not defined
    at <anonymous>:1:1
(anonymous)	@	VM17357:1
Explanation

Understanding the problem
This error means that the JavaScript engine tried to execute a function or access a variable named forcePopulateFields, but it couldn't find anything with that name in the current scope or anywhere in the reachable scopes. In essence, you're trying to use something that hasn't been defined or declared yet.

Suggested fix
Define the forcePopulateFields function before attempting to call it.

js

function forcePopulateFields() {
  // Your function logic goes here
  console.log("forcePopulateFields is now defined and called.");
}

forcePopulateFields(); // Now this call will work

Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The Uncaught ReferenceError: forcePopulateFields is not defined error occurs when you try to use a variable or call a function that hasn't been declared or defined in the current JavaScript execution context. To fix it, ensure the variable or function is defined before it is used.

 forceCaptureFormData()
 VM17361:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: forceCaptureFormData is not defined
    at <anonymous>:1:2
(anonymous)	@	VM17361:1
Understanding the problem
The error Uncaught ReferenceError: forceCaptureFormData is not defined indicates that the function forceCaptureFormData is being called, but the JavaScript engine cannot find its definition in the current scope. This usually happens when the function has not been declared or is not accessible from where it's being called.

Suggested fix
Ensure that the function forceCaptureFormData is defined before it is called. This could mean defining the function in the same script, importing it from another module, or ensuring the script containing its definition is loaded before the script that calls it.

Here's a simple example of how to define a function:

js

function forceCaptureFormData() {
  // Function implementation here
  console.log('forceCaptureFormData function called');
}

// Now you can call the function
forceCaptureFormData();
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The ReferenceError means the JavaScript engine doesn't know what forceCaptureFormData is because it hasn't been defined or made available in the scope where it's being used. Define the function before attempting to call it.
