general errors at admin hub open:
error 1 : Understanding the problem
This error indicates that the JavaScript parser encountered a character or sequence of characters that it doesn't recognize as valid JavaScript code at the specified location (admin.html:4781:15). This is a syntax error, meaning the code is malformed according to JavaScript's rules.

Suggested fix
Review the code at line 4781, character 15 in admin.html. Look for mistyped characters, incorrect punctuation, or mismatched quotes/parentheses/braces. The error message specifically points to "Invalid or unexpected token," so the issue is likely a single character or a small sequence of characters that doesn't fit into the expected syntax.

Here are some common culprits:

Incorrectly placed symbols: For example, a stray semicolon, comma, or operator.
Mismatched quotes: Using a mix of single and double quotes incorrectly, or missing a closing quote.
Reserved words used as variable names: Using keywords like function, var, let, const, class, etc., as variable names.
Invisible characters: Sometimes, non-printable characters can get copied and pasted into code.
Summary
The Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token error means there's a problem with the JavaScript code's structure at the specified location. Carefully inspect the code at the indicated line and character for syntax mistakes.

Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener') indicates that you are trying to call the addEventListener method on a variable or object that currently holds the value null. This usually happens when you try to select an HTML element using JavaScript, but the element with the specified selector is not found in the document.

How to verify
Identify the line number mentioned in the error (in this case, lineno: 28 in admin.js).
Look at the code on that line and the lines immediately preceding it to see what element is being selected and on what variable addEventListener is being called.
Inspect your HTML document to confirm if an element with the corresponding selector actually exists and is available in the DOM when that JavaScript code is executed.
Suggested fix
Ensure that the element you are trying to attach an event listener to exists in the DOM before you try to access it and call addEventListener. You can do this by checking if the element variable is not null before calling the method, or by ensuring your script runs after the DOM has been fully loaded.

Here's an example of how to add a check for the element's existence:

js

const myElement = document.getElementById('my-element-id'); // Replace with your actual selector

if (myElement) {
  myElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Your event handler code
  });
} else {
  console.error('Element with ID "my-element-id" not found.');
}
Use code snippets with caution

Alternatively, if your script is in the <head>, move it to the end of the <body> or wrap your code in a DOMContentLoaded listener:

js

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const myElement = document.getElementById('my-element-id');

  if (myElement) {
    myElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
      // Your event handler code
    });
  }
});
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener') occurs when you attempt to add an event listener to an element that was not found, resulting in a null value. To fix this, ensure the element exists in the DOM before attempting to add the listener, either by checking if the element variable is null or by running your script after the DOM is loaded.
