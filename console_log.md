error 1:
Understanding the problem
The console error Admin settings save error: Error: HTTP 401: indicates that a request made to a server-side resource returned a 401 Unauthorized status code. This usually means that the request was sent without valid authentication credentials, or the credentials provided were insufficient to access the requested resource. The traceback at sendToWebhook (webhook.js:64:11) suggests that the error occurred during a call to a function named sendToWebhook, likely an attempt to send data to a webhook endpoint. The subsequent traceback at async HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (admin.html:410:28) indicates that this action was triggered by clicking an HTML button element within admin.html.

How to verify
You can verify this by checking the "Network" tab in Chrome DevTools. When the error occurs, look for a request that resulted in a 401 status code. The request details will show the URL being accessed and potentially information about the headers sent. This will help confirm which specific request is failing due to authorization issues.

Suggested fix
The fix for a 401 error depends on how authentication is handled on your server and in your client-side code. Common approaches include:

Ensure Authentication Tokens are Present: If your application uses tokens (like JWTs or session IDs) for authentication, make sure they are being included in the request headers (e.g., in the Authorization header).
Verify Token Validity: If tokens are being sent, ensure they are not expired or invalid.
Check Server-Side Authentication Logic: Review the server-side code that handles the webhook endpoint (sendToWebhook likely interacts with this) to ensure it's correctly validating the provided credentials.
Refresh Authentication: If the user's session may have expired, you might need to implement a mechanism to refresh the authentication or prompt the user to log in again.
Since the provided code snippet is only handling the error and not making the request, the fix needs to happen in the code that calls sendToWebhook or within the sendToWebhook function itself to ensure proper authentication.

Summary
A "HTTP 401 Unauthorized" error means your request was rejected because of missing or invalid authentication credentials. To fix this, ensure your client-side code is sending the correct authentication information with the request and verify that your server-side endpoint is properly handling authentication.

error 2 :
Understanding the problem
The console message POST https://hook.eu2.make.com/xwr4rxw9sp1v16ihuw4ldgyxa312hg2p 401 (Unauthorized) indicates that the HTTP POST request made to the specified URL received a 401 Unauthorized status code from the server. This means the server rejected the request because it requires some form of authentication or authorization that was not provided or was invalid.

How to verify
You can verify this by inspecting the Network tab in Chrome DevTools. Look for the request to https://hook.eu2.make.com/xwr4rxw9sp1v16ihuw4ldgyxa312hg2p. Click on it and check the "Status Code" under the "Headers" tab. It will show "401 Unauthorized".

Suggested fix
The fix involves providing the necessary authentication or authorization credentials with your request. The exact method depends on how the Make.com webhook is configured to authenticate requests. Common methods include:

API Key in URL: The webhook URL might require an API key directly in the URL as a query parameter.
API Key in Headers: The API key or a token might need to be sent in a custom HTTP header (e.g., Authorization).
Basic Authentication: The server might expect a username and password encoded in the Authorization header.
Consult the documentation or configuration for your Make.com webhook to determine the required authentication method and credentials.

Here's an example of how to add an API key to the URL using the fetch API:

js

fetch(url + '?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY', options);
Use code snippets with caution

Here's an example of how to add an Authorization header:

js

const optionsWithAuth = {
  ...options,
  headers: {
    ...options.headers,
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' // Or whatever format is required
  }
};
fetch(url, optionsWithAuth);
Use code snippets with caution

Replace YOUR_API_KEY or YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN with your actual credentials.

Summary
The 401 Unauthorized error means your request was rejected by the server due to missing or invalid authentication. To fix this, you need to include the correct authentication credentials (like an API key or token) in your fetch request, as required by the Make.com webhook configuration.

error 3 
Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught (in promise) Error: Webhook [DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE] not registered indicates that the code attempted to send a request to a webhook identified by DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE, but this webhook ID was not found in the WEBHOOKS object. The sendToWebhook function explicitly checks if the url is falsy (which happens if WEBHOOKS[id] is undefined) and throws this specific error.

Suggested fix
Ensure that WEBHOOKS object is defined and contains a property with the key DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE whose value is the URL of the webhook you intend to call.

js

// Make sure your WEBHOOKS object is defined somewhere before this code
const WEBHOOKS = {
  // ... other webhooks if any
  DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE: 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE', // Replace 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE' with the actual URL
  // ...
};

async function sendToWebhook(id, payload) {
  const url = WEBHOOKS[id];
  if (!url) {
    throw new Error(`Webhook [${id}] not registered`);
  }

  const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    body: payload instanceof FormData ? payload : JSON.stringify(payload)
  };
  if (!(payload instanceof FormData)) {
    options.headers = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' };
  }

  const res = await fetch(url, options);
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP ${res.status}: ${res.statusText}`);
  }
}

// Example usage somewhere in your code
// sendToWebhook('DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE', yourPayload);

Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error "Webhook [DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE] not registered" occurs because the DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE key is missing from the WEBHOOKS object, which prevents the code from finding the corresponding webhook URL. The fix is to define DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE within the WEBHOOKS object with the correct webhook URL as its value.

error 4 :

Understanding the problem
The console message is an error report that was explicitly logged by your sendErrorReport function. The underlying issue is an "Unhandled Promise Rejection" with the specific reason being "Error: Webhook \[DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE] not registered". This indicates that a Promise within your application was rejected, and there was no .catch() handler or try...catch block around the asynchronous operation to handle the rejection. The error reporting mechanism you've set up caught this unhandled rejection and logged it to the console.

Suggested fix
To fix this, you need to identify the asynchronous operation that is attempting to use the DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE webhook and ensure that its Promise rejection is handled. This typically involves adding a .catch() block to the Promise or wrapping the await call in a try...catch block.

Find the code that looks something like this:

js

someAsyncFunctionUsingWebhook(DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE)
  .then(...)
  // .catch(...) // <--- Add a catch block here
Use code snippets with caution

Or if you're using async/await:

js

async someFunction() {
  try {
    await someAsyncFunctionUsingWebhook(DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE);
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle the error here, e.g., log it or show a user message
    console.error('Error using webhook:', error);
  }
}
Use code snippets with caution

Add appropriate error handling to the Promise or async operation.

Summary
The error "Unhandled Promise Rejection: Webhook \[DEV_ADMIN_UPDATE] not registered" means a Promise was rejected without a handler. The fix is to add a .catch() or try...catch block to the asynchronous operation causing the rejection.
