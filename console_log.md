general errors at admin hub open:
error 1 : Understanding the problem
This error indicates that the JavaScript parser encountered a character or sequence of characters that it doesn't recognize as valid JavaScript code at the specified location (admin.html:4781:15). This is a syntax error, meaning the code is malformed according to JavaScript's rules.

Suggested fix
Review the code at line 4781, character 15 in admin.html. Look for mistyped characters, incorrect punctuation, or mismatched quotes/parentheses/braces. The error message specifically points to "Invalid or unexpected token," so the issue is likely a single character or a small sequence of characters that doesn't fit into the expected syntax.

Here are some common culprits:

Incorrectly placed symbols: For example, a stray semicolon, comma, or operator.
Mismatched quotes: Using a mix of single and double quotes incorrectly, or missing a closing quote.
Reserved words used as variable names: Using keywords like function, var, let, const, class, etc., as variable names.
Invisible characters: Sometimes, non-printable characters can get copied and pasted into code.
Summary
The Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token error means there's a problem with the JavaScript code's structure at the specified location. Carefully inspect the code at the indicated line and character for syntax mistakes.

Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener') indicates that you are trying to call the addEventListener method on a variable or object that currently holds the value null. This usually happens when you try to select an HTML element using JavaScript, but the element with the specified selector is not found in the document.

How to verify
Identify the line number mentioned in the error (in this case, lineno: 28 in admin.js).
Look at the code on that line and the lines immediately preceding it to see what element is being selected and on what variable addEventListener is being called.
Inspect your HTML document to confirm if an element with the corresponding selector actually exists and is available in the DOM when that JavaScript code is executed.
Suggested fix
Ensure that the element you are trying to attach an event listener to exists in the DOM before you try to access it and call addEventListener. You can do this by checking if the element variable is not null before calling the method, or by ensuring your script runs after the DOM has been fully loaded.

Here's an example of how to add a check for the element's existence:

js

const myElement = document.getElementById('my-element-id'); // Replace with your actual selector

if (myElement) {
  myElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Your event handler code
  });
} else {
  console.error('Element with ID "my-element-id" not found.');
}
Use code snippets with caution

Alternatively, if your script is in the <head>, move it to the end of the <body> or wrap your code in a DOMContentLoaded listener:

js

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const myElement = document.getElementById('my-element-id');

  if (myElement) {
    myElement.addEventListener('click', () => {
      // Your event handler code
    });
  }
});
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener') occurs when you attempt to add an event listener to an element that was not found, resulting in a null value. To fix this, ensure the element exists in the DOM before attempting to add the listener, either by checking if the element variable is null or by running your script after the DOM is loaded.

Parts search results - floating screen 
errors from console :
error 1 :
The error message Uncaught ReferenceError: openPartsResultsFloating is not defined indicates that the JavaScript code is trying to call a function named openPartsResultsFloating, but this function has not been declared or is not accessible in the current scope. The error report shows that this happened on line 961, column 75 of validation-dashboard.html. The provided code snippet for sendErrorReport is likely what logs the error report itself, not the cause of the ReferenceError.

Suggested fix
Ensure that the function openPartsResultsFloating is defined within a script tag in your HTML or in a separate JavaScript file that is loaded before the code that attempts to call it. Make sure there are no typos in the function name.

For example, if openPartsResultsFloating should open a floating element:

js

// Define the function
function openPartsResultsFloating() {
  // Code to open the floating element
  console.log("Opening parts results floating");
  // Add your actual logic here
}

// Later in your code, you can call the function:
// openPartsResultsFloating(); // This call will now work

Use code snippets with caution

Alternatively, if openPartsResultsFloating is meant to be a method of an object, ensure the object is defined and the method exists:

js

const uiHelper = {
  openPartsResultsFloating: function() {
    // Code to open the floating element
    console.log("Opening parts results floating");
    // Add your actual logic here
  }
};

// Later in your code, you would call it like this:
// uiHelper.openPartsResultsFloating();
Use code snippets with caution

Locate the code around line 961 in validation-dashboard.html and verify how openPartsResultsFloating is being called. Then, ensure the function is correctly defined and available before that point.

Summary
The error Uncaught ReferenceError: openPartsResultsFloating is not defined means the function being called doesn't exist or isn't in scope. Define the function openPartsResultsFloating before it is called to resolve the error.

error 2 
Understanding the problem
The error "Uncaught ReferenceError: openPartsResultsFloating is not defined" means that when the button with the onclick attribute openPartsResultsFloating() was clicked, the browser could not find a function with that name in the current scope.

Suggested fix
Ensure that a JavaScript function named openPartsResultsFloating is defined and accessible in the global scope or in the scope where the button's onclick event is being processed. You need to add the following code block to your HTML page:

html

<script>
  // Define the openPartsResultsFloating function
  function openPartsResultsFloating() {
    // Add the code to open the parts results floating window here
    console.log("openPartsResultsFloating function called");
    // Example: window.open('parts_results.html', '_blank', 'width=600,height=400');
  }
</script>
Use code snippets with caution

Place this script block either in the <head> section of your HTML or just before the closing </body> tag. Make sure the actual implementation of the function (the code that opens the floating window) is included within the function body.

Summary
The error occurred because the browser tried to execute a JavaScript function (openPartsResultsFloating) that was not defined. The solution is to create a JavaScript function with that exact name.
