Understanding the problem
The error message "Failed to request expertise report: undefined" indicates that the response variable in your console.error statement is undefined. This happens because the sendToWebhook function likely threw an error or did not return a value when an error occurred during the webhook call.

Suggested fix
Modify the catch block to handle potential errors during the webhook call and provide a more informative error message in the console.

js

const response = await sendToWebhook('CALL_EXPERTISE', payload);

        if (response?.success) {
          alert('חוות הדעת נשלחה בהצלחה! בדוק את האימייל שלך לקבלת הקובץ.');
          console.log('✅ Expertise report requested successfully');
        } else {
          alert('שגיאה בשליחת בקשה לחוות דעת. אנא נסה שוב.');
          // Log the entire response object if it exists, otherwise log the error
          console.error('❌ Failed to request expertise report:', response || 'Error during webhook call');
        }

Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error "Failed to request expertise report: undefined" means the response from sendToWebhook was undefined. The fix involves ensuring the catch block logs a meaningful message, potentially including the actual error, when the webhook call fails.

    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (admin.html:1:1)
window.toggleSection	@	admin.html:3734
onclick	@	admin.html:1
Explanation

Understanding the problem
The error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')" means that you are trying to access the style property of a variable that is currently null. In this case, the variable is likely the content variable, which is supposed to represent an HTML element. This happens when document.getElementById(sectionId + '-content') does not find an element with the specified ID, and thus returns null.

Suggested fix
Ensure that the HTML element with the ID constructed from sectionId + '-content' actually exists on the page before attempting to access its style property. You can add a check to see if the element was found:

js

// Collapsible Section Management
    window.toggleSection = function(sectionId) {
      const content = document.getElementById(sectionId + '-content');
      const icon = document.getElementById(sectionId + '-icon');

      // Add a check to ensure the element exists
      if (content) {
        if (content.style.display === 'none') {
          content.style.display = 'block';
          if (icon) { // Also check if the icon element exists
            icon.textContent = '🔽';
          }
          sessionStorage.setItem(`section-${sectionId}`, 'expanded');
        } else {
          content.style.display = 'none';
          if (icon) { // Also check if the icon element exists
            icon.textContent = '🔼';
          }
          sessionStorage.setItem(`section-${sectionId}`, 'collapsed');
        }
      } else {
        console.error(`Element with ID ${sectionId}-content not found.`);
      }
    };

Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error occurs because document.getElementById() returned null. The fix is to check if the element was found before trying to access its properties.

error 2 :
💥 Error Report: {message: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')", filename: 'https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.html', lineno: 3734, colno: 19, error: 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading…//yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.html:1:1)', …}
sendErrorReport @ environment-config.js:398
(anonymous) @ environment-config.js:379
Explanation

Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style') indicates that you are trying to access the style property of a variable or expression that currently holds the value null. This usually happens when you try to manipulate the style of an HTML element that doesn't exist or hasn't been found in the DOM.

The error report shows that this error occurred at line 3734 in the file https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.html.

The provided code for sendErrorReport is not the direct cause of the TypeError. This function is being called because the TypeError happened elsewhere in your code, likely within the admin.html file around line 3734, and your error reporting mechanism is catching and reporting it.

How to verify
Open your web application in Chrome.
Open DevTools and go to the "Elements" tab.
Examine the HTML structure of your page to confirm whether the element you are trying to access around line 3734 of your JavaScript code actually exists and has the expected ID, class, or tag name.
In the "Console" tab, click on the link next to the error message (https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.html:3734:19) to jump to the exact line of code where the error occurred. Inspect the variable or expression that is null right before the access to the .style property.
Suggested fix
The fix involves identifying the line of code around line 3734 where you are attempting to access the style property and ensuring that the element you are targeting actually exists before trying to manipulate its style.

Locate the code around line 3734 in your admin.html file (or a JavaScript file sourced by it). Look for code that tries to access an element, likely using methods like document.getElementById, document.querySelector, or similar.
