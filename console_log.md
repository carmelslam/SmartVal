**The estimate report link  direct to a broken page**
console error :
 
 GET https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/estimate.html 404 (Not Found)
Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console error GET https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/estimate.html 404 (Not Found) indicates that your browser tried to fetch the file estimate.html from the server at https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app, but the server responded with a 404 status code. This means the server could not find a resource at that specific URL.

The initializeSessionMode function at line 752 of estimate-builder.html seems to be initiating this request, likely attempting to navigate to or fetch content from estimate.html.

Suggested fix
The fix is to ensure that the file estimate.html exists in the correct location on your Netlify site's deployed files.

Check your local project: Verify that estimate.html exists in the root directory or the expected path relative to where estimate-builder.html is located.
Check your build process: If you have a build process, ensure that estimate.html is included in the output directory that Netlify deploys.
Check Netlify deploy logs: Review your recent Netlify deploy logs to see if estimate.html was successfully uploaded and placed in the correct location.
Verify deployed files on Netlify: You can inspect the deployed files directly on the Netlify dashboard for your site to confirm the presence and path of estimate.html.
Once you've confirmed the file exists in your project and is included in the deployment, redeploy your site to Netlify.

Summary
The 404 error for estimate.html means the file was not found on the server at the requested URL. The solution is to ensure the file exists in your project, is included in your build process (if any), and is successfully deployed to the correct location on Netlify.

report-selection.html:326 Error loading plate data: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'success')
    at handlePlateInput (report-selection.html:291:22)
Understanding the problem
The error message TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'success') indicates that your code is trying to access the success property of a variable that is currently undefined. The stack trace shows this is happening within the handlePlateInput function, specifically on line 291. The provided code snippet doesn't show the line where 'success' is being accessed, but it does show that the code is handling an error. This suggests that the structure of the error object might not be what is expected, leading to the attempt to read a property from an undefined value.

How to verify
You can verify this by setting a breakpoint on line 291 of report-selection.html within the handlePlateInput function. When the debugger pauses, inspect the value of the variable you are attempting to read the .success property from. You will likely find that this variable is undefined.

Suggested fix
The fix involves checking if the object you are trying to access the success property from is defined before attempting to access the property. This is often done using optional chaining (?.) or an if condition. Without seeing the exact line of code causing the error, a general solution is to add a check. For example, if you were trying to access error.response.success, you would modify it to error.response?.success.

js

console.error('Error loading plate data:', error);

        // Add checks before accessing properties
        if (error && error.response && error.response.success) {
          // Your code that accesses error.response.success goes here
        }

        // Even on error, save basic plate data
        const basicData = {
          meta: {
            plate: plateNumber,
            case_id: `CASE-${plateNumber}-${Date.now()}`,
            created_at: new Date().toISOString()
          },
          vehicle: {
            plate_number: plateNumber
          }
        };

        sessionStorage.setItem('helper', JSON.stringify(basicData));
        sessionStorage.setItem('plate', plateNumber);

        plateDataLoaded = true;
Use code snippets with caution

Alternatively, using optional chaining:

js

console.error('Error loading plate data:', error);

        // Use optional chaining
        const isSuccessful = error?.response?.success;
        if (isSuccessful) {
          // Your code that uses the success value goes here
        }

        // Even on error, save basic plate data
        const basicData = {
          meta: {
            plate: plateNumber,
            case_id: `CASE-${plateNumber}-${Date.now()}`,
            created_at: new Date().toISOString()
          },
          vehicle: {
            plate_number: plateNumber
          }
        };

        sessionStorage.setItem('helper', JSON.stringify(basicData));
        sessionStorage.setItem('plate', plateNumber);

        plateDataLoaded = true;

Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'success') occurs when you try to access the success property of an undefined object. To fix this, ensure the object is defined before attempting to access its properties by using conditional checks or optional chaining.
