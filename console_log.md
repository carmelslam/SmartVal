Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style') indicates that you are trying to access the style property of a variable or expression that currently holds the value null. This usually happens when you try to manipulate the style of an HTML element that doesn't exist or hasn't been found in the DOM.

The error report shows that this error occurred at line 3734 in the file https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.html.

The provided code for sendErrorReport is not the direct cause of the TypeError. This function is being called because the TypeError happened elsewhere in your code, likely within the admin.html file around line 3734, and your error reporting mechanism is catching and reporting it.

How to verify
Open your web application in Chrome.
Open DevTools and go to the "Elements" tab.
Examine the HTML structure of your page to confirm whether the element you are trying to access around line 3734 of your JavaScript code actually exists and has the expected ID, class, or tag name.
In the "Console" tab, click on the link next to the error message (https://yaron-cayouf-portal.netlify.app/admin.html:3734:19) to jump to the exact line of code where the error occurred. Inspect the variable or expression that is null right before the access to the .style property.
Suggested fix
The fix involves identifying the line of code around line 3734 where you are attempting to access the style property and ensuring that the element you are targeting actually exists before trying to manipulate its style.

Locate the code around line 3734 in your admin.html file (or a JavaScript file sourced by it). Look for code that tries to access an element, likely using methods like document.getElementById, document.querySelector, or similar.

Here's a common pattern and how to fix it:

js

// Original code (example - not your exact code):
const myElement = document.getElementById('some-id');
myElement.style.display = 'none'; // This line would throw the error if myElement is null

// Suggested fix: Add a check to ensure the element exists
const myElement = document.getElementById('some-id');
if (myElement) { // Check if the element was found
  myElement.style.display = 'none';
} else {
  console.warn("Element with ID 'some-id' not found."); // Optional: Log a warning
}

Use code snippets with caution

Apply this pattern to the specific line causing the error in your code.

Summary
The Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style') error means you are trying to access the style property of something that is null. This is likely because an HTML element you expected to find was not found in the DOM. To fix this, ensure the element exists before attempting to modify its style, typically by adding a check for null or undefined after retrieving the element.
error 2 :
admin.html:3734 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')
    at window.toggleSection (admin.html:3734:19)
    at HTMLButtonElement.onclick (admin.html:1:1)
window.toggleSection	@	admin.html:3734
onclick	@	admin.html:1

Understanding the problem
The error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style')" means that you are trying to access the style property of a variable that is currently null. In this case, the variable is likely the content variable, which is supposed to represent an HTML element. This happens when document.getElementById(sectionId + '-content') does not find an element with the specified ID, and thus returns null.

Suggested fix
Ensure that the HTML element with the ID constructed from sectionId + '-content' actually exists on the page before attempting to access its style property. You can add a check to see if the element was found:

js

// Collapsible Section Management
    window.toggleSection = function(sectionId) {
      const content = document.getElementById(sectionId + '-content');
      const icon = document.getElementById(sectionId + '-icon');

      // Add a check to ensure the element exists
      if (content) {
        if (content.style.display === 'none') {
          content.style.display = 'block';
          if (icon) { // Also check if the icon element exists
            icon.textContent = 'üîΩ';
          }
          sessionStorage.setItem(`section-${sectionId}`, 'expanded');
        } else {
          content.style.display = 'none';
          if (icon) { // Also check if the icon element exists
            icon.textContent = 'üîº';
          }
          sessionStorage.setItem(`section-${sectionId}`, 'collapsed');
        }
      } else {
        console.error(`Element with ID ${sectionId}-content not found.`);
      }
    };

Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error occurs because document.getElementById() returned null. The fix is to check if the element was found before trying to access its properties.
